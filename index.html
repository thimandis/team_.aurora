        <font size="6" face="jasmineUPC"><P> Our Star-The Sun
 is the closest star to Earth,at a mean distance from our 
planet of 149.60 million kilometers (92.96 million miles). This distance is known as an astronomical unit (abbreviated AU),and sets 
the scale for measuring distances all across the solar system.The 
Sun,a huge sphere of mostly ionized gas, supports life on Earth.It 
powers photosynthesis in green plants, and is ultimately the source 
of all food and fossil fuel. 
The connection and interactions between the sun and earth drive 
the seasons,ocean currents,weather,and climate. <br/></p>
        <p> The Sun is 332,900 times more massive than Earth and contains 
99.86 percent of the mass of the entire solar system. It is held 
together by gravitational attraction, producing immense pressure 
and temperature at its core. The sun has six regions-the core,the 
radiative zone, and the convective zone in the interior,the visible 
surface,known as the photosphere; the chromosphere; and the 
outermost region, the corona.<br/><p>
        <p> At the core, the temperature is about 15 million degrees Celsius 
(about 27 million degrees Fahrenheit), which is sufficient to sustain 
thermonuclear fusion. The energy produced in the core powers the 
Sun and produces essentially all the heat and light we receive on 
Earth,Energy from the core bounces around the radiative zone, 
taking about 170,000 years to get to the convective zone. The tem
perature drops below 2 million degrees Celsius (3.5 million degrees 
Fahrenheit) in the convective zone,where large bubbles of hot 
plasma (a soup of ionized atoms) move upwards. <br/><p>
        <p> The Sun's "surface" the photosphere is a 500 kilometer thick(300 
mile-thick) region, from which most of the Sun's radiation escapes 
outward and is detected as the sunlight we observe here on Earth 
about eight minutes after it leaves the Sun. Sun-spots in the photosphere are areas with strong magnetic, fields that are cooler, and 
thus darker,than the surrounding region. <br/><p>
        <p> The temperature of the photosphere is about 5,500 degrees Cel
sius (10,000 degrees Fahrenheit). Above the photosphere lie the 
tenuous chromosphere and the corona.Visible light from these top 
regions is usually too weak to be seen against the brighter photosphere,but during total solar eclipses, when the Moon covers the 
photosphere,the chromosphere can be seen as a red rim around 
the Sun and the corona forms a beautiful white halo. <br/><p>
        <p> Above the photosphere,the temperature increases with altitude, 
reaching temperatures as high as 2 million degrees Celsius (3.5 
million degrees Fahrenheit).The source of coronal heating has been 
scientific mystery for more than 50 years. Likely solutions have 
emerged from observations by the Solar and Heliospheric observatory (SOHO) and the transition region and Coronal Explorer 
(TRACE) missions,which found patches of magnetic field cover
ing the entire solar surface.Scientists now think that this magnetic 
carpet is probably a source of the corona's intense heat.The corona cools rapidly, losing heat as radiation and in the form of the 
solar wind-a stream of charged particles that flows to the edge of 
the solar system. <br/><p></font>

        <font size="6" face="jasmineUPC"><p> Parker Solar Exploration is an unusual and memorable mission to explore what the last region of the solar system can be viewed from a spacecraft: the Sun's atmosphere, the outer corona. When it is finally close to 3.7 million miles from the surface of the sun, the Parker Solar Probe repeatedly the environment near the sun's rays, revolutionizing our knowledge and understanding of the origin and evolution of coronal warming and solar winds.Furthermore, the Solar Probe Plus will make a significant contribution to our ability to characterize and predict the radiation environment in which future astronauts work, by performing spatial measurements in the region of the most hazardous solar energy particle energy.  The spacecraft has a large sun shield that will withstand temperatures of up to 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit so that equipment placed in the shade of the sun shield can stay at room temperature.The first NASA spacecraft named after a living person, Honoring nonagenarian physicist EUGENE NEWMAN PARKER, professor at Chicago University.A memory card containing the names of over 1.1 million people was mounted on a plaque and installed below the spacecraft's high-gain antenna on 18 May 2018. The card also contains photos of Parker and a copy of his 1958 scientific paper predicting important aspects of solar physics. </p>
        <p><b> Orbit: </b> The Parker Solar Probe enters an elliptical orbit around the Sun. Using seven Venus flybies, the orbit will be reduced in size over a period of about seven years. The Parker Solar Probe orbits the sun 24 times, gradually "walking" towards the sun with each passport. The closest places in each orbit are in Mercury, the closest planet to the Sun.In the final three orbits, the Parker Solar Probe will fly within 3.7 million miles of the Sun's surface. It is seven times closer than the currently recorded Helios spacecraft.</p></font>

        <p><b> Discoveries: </b><br/>First four research papers were published describing findings during the spacecraft's first two dives near the Sun.   They recorded the direction and strength of the Sun's magnetic field, and described abnormally frequent and short - term changes in the Sun's magnetic field. That experiment observed roughly a thousand "rogue" magnetic waves in the solar atmosphere, causing solar winds to accelerate up to 300,000 miles per hour, sometimes completely reversing the local magnetic field.Using the "electron beam flowing through the magnetic field", they reported that they were able to observe that the reversals in the Sun's magnetic field are often associated with localized enhancements of the radial component of the plasma velocity (velocity  from the center of the Sun in that direction).  The researchers discovered an amazingly large azimuthal component of the plasma velocity (velocity perpendicular to the radial direction). This component results from the force with which the Sun's rotation slingshots plasma out of the corona when the plasma is released from the coronal magnetic field.</p></font>
        <h1><font size="8" color="maroon" face="colonna MT"> SOHO-Solar and Heliospheric Observatory:</font></h1>
        <center><img src="SOHO1.png" length="470" width="500"></center>
        <p><font size="6" color="red"><center> Launch: December 02, 1995 </center></font></p>
        <font size="6" face="jasmineUPC"><p> Soho, a joint mission of ESA / NASA, studies the sun, from deep inside its core to the outer corona and solar wind. SOHO, a workhorse at NASA's Heliophysical Systems Observatory, has been photographing dynamic flames and coronal mass ejections on the Sun since 1996.The mission provided an unprecedented breadth and depth of the sun, providing a unique collection of instruments that study its interior through the warm and dynamic atmosphere to the solar wind, and its interaction with interstellar medium.Its coronagraphs- images of the sun blocking the center of the sun and observing the atmosphere - remain a key element in predicting the speed, direction, and strength of coronal mass ejections. In addition to observing the Sun, SOHO has become the most prolific discoverer of comets in astronomical history: as of 2012, over 2000 comets have been found by SOHO.</p>
        <p><b> Reason why SOHO discovers many comets: </b><br/> "SOHO is uniquely placed in space and uniquely designed, and its these aspects of the spacecraft that allow it to see and discover so many comets," said Karl Battams, a space scientist at the Naval Research Lab in Washington, D.C. </p>
        <p> SOHO carries and instrument called 'Coronograph'
that uses a solid disk, to block out the Sun's bright face, revealing the much fainter outer atmosphere, the corona. 
Scientists use these images of the corona to study how this part of the atmosphere changes and to track occasional explosions of material from the Sun, called coronal mass ejections. SOHO's vantage point between the Sun and Earth, about a million miles from Earth, gives it a constant view of the Sun's atmosphere.
SOHO's coronagraph, known as LASCO, has both high sensitivity and a wide field of view, which turns out to be perfectly suited to see so-called sungrazing comets that fly too close to the Sun's overwhelmingly bright face to be seen from Earth or with most other scientific instruments. And because SOHO has kept a steady eye on the corona through which these comets fly almost continuously for nearly 25 years, its data has revealed thousands of previously unknown comets: 3,953 as of May 2020. </p>
        <p> Almost all of SOHO's comet discoveries have come from its coronagraph data, but a small handful of comets have been discovered in images from a different instrument on board: the SWAN instrument, a camera designed to look for interactions between the solar wind and hydrogen atoms in space. Some comets, including Comet SWAN discovered in April 2020, outgas large amounts of water of which hydrogen is the main component as they approach the Sun, making them visible to SWAN. </p>
        <p> Around 85% of the thousands of comets discovered by SOHO are members of one family of comets: the Kreutz group. </p>
        <p> SOHO's data has proven a prime hunting ground for previously-undiscovered comets, but that doesn't mean the going is easy. Most of the discoveries have been made through the painstaking work of citizen scientists with the Sungrazer Project, a NASA-funded project managed by Battams that grew out of early citizen science comet discoveries not long after SOHO launched in 1995. </p>
        <p> Beyond that, the comets spotted by SOHO can also act as celestial windsocks, revealing new information about the solar wind and solar atmosphere that they fly through. </p>
        <p><b> Orbit: </b> SOHO orbits around the sun in step with Earth, by slowly orbiting around the first Lagrangian point (L1), approximately 950 thousand miles away from Earth (about four times the distance of the Moon), in the direction of the sun. This offers a continuous view of the sun.</p></font>

        <p><b> Discoveries: </b><br/> The SOHO observed that the sun shines brighter as sun spot activity increases, and analyzed the element coming through the "solar wind" as the air currents flow down the surface of the sun - the continuous flow of the sun's blood flowing into space.Perhaps its most important discovery is the study of how coronal mass ejections creates a "highway" in space for energetic particles to pass through space. The more we know about these particles, the more we will be able to protect infrastructure such as the astronauts and the power system.Because SOHO has been looking at the sun for so long, astronomers have been able to look at the sun through more than one of its 11-year sunspot cycles. These long-term observations of the sun are intended to improve the accuracy of space weather forecasts.</p></font>
